MicroService Foundation
=======================

> **ALPHA:** Lile is currently considered "Alpha" in that things may change. Currently I am gathering feedback and will finalise Lile shortly to avoid breaking changes going forward.

This package provides a foundation to build [gRPC](google.golang.org/grpc) based microservices.

It takes care of:

- Server initialization
- Logging
- Metrics
- Middleware

# Dependencies

You should vendor the dependencies needed in your project. Depending on the features used the
